<p class="about-text">
I am a Data Scientist/Software Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://phyt.health/"> Phyt.health</a>. Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in Data Science and System Complexity from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rug.nl/masters/computing-science/?lang=en"> University of Groningen</a>, where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.rug.nl/~george/"> Dr. George Azzopardi</a>. My research interests include computer vision, data science, brain-inspired algorithms and adversarial machine learning. I am particularly interested in understanding the vulnerability of existing models to natural noise and adversarial attacks. My current research focuses on developing brain-inspired algorithm to enhance the confidence and generalizability of existing models while making them robust to natural noise and adversarial attacks.
