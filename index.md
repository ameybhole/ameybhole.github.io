Hi, I am a Data Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://dairydatawarehouse.com/"> Dairy Data Warehouse (DDW)</a>. I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in Data Science and System Complexity from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rug.nl/masters/computing-science/?lang=en"> University of Groningen</a>, where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.rug.nl/~george/"> Dr. George Azzopardi</a>. My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, scalability, brain-inspired algorithms and adversarial machine learning. I am particularly interested in understanding the vulnerability of existing models and develop methods to enhance models confidence, scalability, explainability, robustness and generalizability.
